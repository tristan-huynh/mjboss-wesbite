<Note type="note" title="Note">
  To have intents enabled, you must enabled them through the <code>/togglelistener</code> command. This will allow the bot to listen to events in the guild, such as member updates, message reactions, etc. 
  If you do not enable intents, the bot will not be able to perform certain actions or respond to certain commands.

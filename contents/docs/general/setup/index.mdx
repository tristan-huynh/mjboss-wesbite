<Note type="warning" title="Warning">
  Doing this process requires two elements:
  1. A [Discord server](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/204849977-How-do-I-create-a-server-) where you have permission to invite bots.
  2. Having `Administrator` permissions in that server.
</Note>

## Overview
To invite the bot to your server, use the following [link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1092967031525081118). Make sure you do not edit the permissions the web page will ask for, as they are completely needed for the bot to function properly.
